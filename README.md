# Flow Todos Client

This is the flow todos client repo. Flow todos is a small web app that tracks your energy, engagement, and flow on your to do list.

This client is a React/Redux app, and I would eventually like to integrate this into a chrome extension to use as a todo app for my empty pages. 

The big value add to every other to do app out there is that this app is designed to reflect the energy, engagement, and flow tracking that is promoted in the book [Designing Your Life](http://designingyour.life/)

The server repo is here (link to be added).

The db repo is here (link to be added).

### Technologies

This app is built using react and redux, and is intended to eventually become a chrome extension.
